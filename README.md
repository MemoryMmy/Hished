A High Performance Viewshed Analysis System based on Hybrid Parallel Architecture


This demonstration presents an online viewshed analysis system named HiShed, which is based on hybrid parallel computing architecture, and has addressed a series of problems and weaknesses of the existing systems. HiShed is featured by (i) MPI+OpenMP based parallel computing of total viewshed for multi observing points in large region, (ii) parallel DEM data access with multi-resolution which ensuring online analysis quality with limited bandwidth and compute resource constraints, and (iii) favorable parallel acceleration and expandability in cluster architecture. The demonstration will show the advantage of HiShed in a cluster of 10 machines and an aliyun virtual server.
